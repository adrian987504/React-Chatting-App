This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform common tasks.<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

# TODO

. Use const on actions creators

. Use === instead of ==

. Use redux-thunk

. Use const INITIAL_STATE on reducers

. Make more adaptative/customizable reducers

. Return {type:..,payload:} on actions creators

. If we use typescript everything needs to be a interface or implement a interface

. Use standard formatter

. Clean CSS, one folder with style. Use LESS/SCSS

. Remove hardcode style inline, ex: { minWidth: 1024 }

# KNOW ISSUES

. Mobile devices are not totally compliant with element on fixed position. We need to find a library to make sure it will work or find another approach.
